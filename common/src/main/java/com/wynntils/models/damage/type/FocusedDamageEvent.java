 * These events are sent when Wynncraft sets up a boss bar for the mob which

 * is tracked by the boss bar, and MobDamaged when the same mob just loses health.
 *
 * Note that other players or environmental damage can also cause the mob to lose
 * health, so the difference in health for MobDamaged might not be due to the current
 * player.
