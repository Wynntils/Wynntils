/**
 * Manages downloading files from the internet. This manager acts as a middle layer between the caller components
 * and {@link NetManager}. It's main purpose is to provide the components a well regulated and managed way
 * of downloading dependency files.
 * <p><b>This manager should not be used for spontaneous downloads. Use one {@link NetManager}'s download methods
 * if you want to download files during running, and not in a pre-planned fashion.</b></p>
 * <p>This component provides multiple tools to ease the development of other components:</p>
 * - The manager can handle dependency resoltion, allowing components to depend on other component's data files, without
 * having to natively code the dependency resolution. As the manager is responsible for every components' downloads,
 * it can also ensure that all dependencies are valid, meaning they are not circular or missing.
 * <br>
 * - The manager can directly handle re-download requests, allowing all data sources to be re-downloaded directly, if
 * the user or system requires it.
 * <br>
 * - The manager can keep track of failed downloads, and easily retry them, knowing that no race conditions will occur
 * on either successful or failed downloads. It can also provide the user with useful information about their cache state.
 * <br>
 * - The manager can handle parallel downloads, within regulated manners, ensuring a stable amount of downloads
 * are happening at any given time. This allows more stable downloads for less stable internet connections. The manager
 * can also provide a clear view of the download queue, and the download progress.
